# Example program from the DMA330 TRM.
# Set up for burst transfers (4-beat burst, so SB4 and DB4), (word data width, so SS32 and DS32)

    # Perform peripheral transfers

    # Outer loop - DMAC responds to peripheral requests until peripheral sets drlast_0 = 1

    DMALPFE


        # Wait for request, DMAC sets request_type0 flag depending on the request type it receives

        DMAWFP 0, periph


        # Set up loop for burst request: first 15 of 16 sets of transactions

        # Note: B suffix - conditionally executed only if request_type0 flag = Burst
